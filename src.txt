helloooo copyyy fixes:
1. b_open RDOnly flags now get set off (we needed to add parenthesis)
2. b_read needs to call getNextBlock when incrementing the currBlock we cant just say curBlock +=1;
3. b_open has two fields to keep track of current block for b_read, but b_read only uses the one named blockOffset
4. wrote parent directory again in b_close() because b_write modifies the fileSize field in thee
